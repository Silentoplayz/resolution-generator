# Resolution Generator
A Python script that generates screen resolutions based on user-defined constraints.

## Features:
- Allows users to define starting and ending resolutions, increment values, and maximum pixel limits.
- Provides an option to filter results by a specific aspect ratio.
- Offers sorting methods to organize the generated resolutions.
- Outputs the results to a text file.

## Usage:
To use the script, you would run it, and it would prompt you for various parameters like starting resolution, ending resolution, increment, maximum pixel limit, etc. After providing the inputs, the script will generate a list of resolutions and present you with options to sort them. Once sorted, the results will be saved to a file named "resolutions.txt".
